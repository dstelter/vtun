1. Compilation and Installation.
In order to compile VTun yourself you need:
  - Good C compiler (gcc, egcs, etc)
  - Lexical Analyzer (flex, lex)
  - YACC (yacc, bison, byacc)
  - Zlib compression library
  - SSleay encryption library ftp://ftp.pca.dfn.de/pub/tools/net/ssleay
Optional:
  - LZO compression library   http://wildsau.idv.uni-linz.ac.at/mfx/lzo.html

In order to use Ethernet and TUN(plain IP tunnel) you need:
  - Universal TUN/TAP driver http://vtun.netpedia.net/tun

To configure VTun run:
  ./configure 

Configure assumes that Crypto library and include files are located in 
/usr/include and /usr/lib. If you use different locations you have to 
supply path to those files. 
For example if libcrypto.a is in /usr/lib/crypto and md5.h and blowfish.h
are in /usr/include/ssl run:
  ./configure --with-crypto-lib=/usr/lib/ssl 
	      --with-crypto-headers=/usr/include/ssl

In order to compile LZO compression module you have to specify path to LZO
header files and library.
For example if liblzo.a is in /usr/lib/lzo and lzo1x.h is in /usr/include/lzo
run:
  ./configure --with-lzo-lib=/usr/lib/lzo 
	      --with-lzo-headers=/usr/include/lzo

By default VTun will be configured to work under /usr/local.
If you want to install it under usual location run:
  ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var

To compile and install run:
  make install

Read manual page for 'vtund' and example of the config file for the 
configuration and other details.
