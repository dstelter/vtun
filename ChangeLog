	 Final 2.0 stable version. Small cleanups. Documentation and Web site updates.

ver 2.0b8: 
         Config file parser fixes. Improved and simplified connection keep 
         alive algorithm. Client lookups server address on every reconnect.
	 Per host automatic statistic logs. Updated RPM package.
	 Created FAQ. Massive documentation update. 

ver 2.0b7: 
         Added new LZO compression module. Compression works with UDP now. 
	 Documentation update. 

ver 2.0b6: 
	 Problem with zombie processes on FreeBSD fixed. Correct statistic 
	 dumps and other minor fixes.
         Documentation update. Mailing list and web site mirror created.

ver 2.0b5: 
	 UDP connection drops and de-synchronization problems fixed. Optimized 
	 read/write frame function for TCP and UDP. Compressor and shaper 
	 cleanups. Persist mode fix. Longer delay after pppd start.
	 Added configure options to specify libcrypto location. 
	 Minor modules fix. Massive spelling fixes.
         Ethernet support for FreeBSD. 
	 UDP changes are not compatible with previous versions. 

ver 2.0b4: 
	 Just stupid :(( authentication bug, which broke 2.0b3, has been fixed.
         Sorry for inconvenience. 
	 Upgrade URGENTLY, 2.0b3 doesn't work !

ver 2.0b3: 
	 Support for plain IP tunneling via TUN device on Linux and FreeBSD.
	 Ethernet support is always compiled and uses new TUN/TAP driver.
	 Network device auto allocation works fine. No need to down net devices
	 manually, TUN driver will do it. 
	 Delay after PPP initialization, fixed problems with routing commands. 
	 Fixed problem with oversized frames. 
	 Several connection drop problems were fixed. 
 	 Minor authentication fix (upgrade both server and client).
         More verbose logging. Several minor fixes.
	 Uses setproctitle when available. 
 	 Created list with known problems and recommendations (README.Problems).

ver 2.0b2: 
	 Persist mode fixed, client now reconnects properly and doesn't
	 eat up CPU. Correct signal handling and graceful termination.
	 Several spelling and bug fixes.  

ver 2.0b: Challenge based authentication (no more clear text passwords).
	 BlowFish encryption. Compression levels. Connection keepalive. 
	 UDP can detect broken connections. Better framing,
	 no more frame fragmentation. Graceful connection close. 
	 Config enhancements. New syntax for commands, it is possible to 
	 run several commands now, separate command sets for established 
	 and closed connection states.  
	 Added 'device' statement to specify static tap device.
	 Better Ethertap handling directly via netlink socket, which
	 is much faster(broke tap device auto allocation). 
	 Statistic dump on SIGUSR1. Solaris and FreeBSD ports. 
	 Several bug fixes.  
	 This version IS NOT COMPATIBLE with previous versions.

ver 1.5: TCP was not set by default. Config parser fixes, better error
	 reporting.
	 Switched to GNU Autoconf(expecting reports). 

ver 1.4: Shaper rewritten to not use floating point calculations. Errors
	 reporting to stderr. Added client source address option '-L'. 
	 RPM package improvements. Code cleanups. Minor config parser fixes.

ver 1.3: Ethernet fixes: tunneled via UDP, fragmentation problem fixed, works 
	 with normal mtu(1500). Preparations to support other protocols via 
	 UDP, added new config option 'proto (udp/tcp)', currently used only 
	 for Ethernet. 
	 Minor config file parser fixes and improvements. Server creates PID 
	 file now. Several typos corrected. 
	 Startup scripts for several distributions take a look at 'scripts'
	 directory.
	 Contributors list created (see Credits), thanks them a lot. 

ver 1.2: Completely new platform independent shaper, implemented as module, 
	 compatible with compression, can shape Ethernet now, does not split 
	 traffic to small chunks and does not add TCP overhead. 
	 Read README.Shaper for more details. 
	 Minor module list improvement. Code cleanup. Spelling corrections. 

ver 1.1: Minor config parser fixes. Traffic handler modules optimizations and 
	 enhancements. Minor tunnel initializer fixes. Fixed several compilation
	 problems with some distributions and libc.

ver 1.0: A lot of improvements and optimizations. 
	 Enhanced config file. Code of the server and the client merged to 
	 the one program 'vtund'. Now support not only PPP but SLIP, most 
	 other serial protocol and programs and Ethernet tunnels via Linux
	 EhterTap device. Modular architecture of handlers(compressor,
	 encryptor,etc), it is easy to write a new handler now. Simple 
	 encryption implemented. Minor shaper fixes. 

VPPP renamed to VTun.

ver 2.1: Some bug fixes. Now support deflate compression via zlib.
	 This is the last release of VPPP, next release will be called
	 VTUN(Virtual Tunnel) 1.0. It will support not only PPP but any 
	 other protocols and programs which runs on tty ports.

ver 2.0: A lot of code reworked and rewritten. Password based 
	 authentication implemented. Config files parser improved
	 and now friendly for spaces and other garbage :)).
	 New config file with servers information for vppp. Shaper
	 reworked(platform dependent constants added) and now can shape 
	 assymetricly(inbound/outbound).
	 This version is not compatible with previous ones due to 
	 authentication changes.

ver 1.2: Several bug fixes. Connection timeouts implemented.
	 Performance improvements.  Code cleanups and optimizations.

ver 1.1: A lot of enhancements and bug fixes. Traffic shaper functionality 
	 added. 

ver 1.0: First revision. Just basic functionality implemented.
